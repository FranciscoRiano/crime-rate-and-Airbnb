# Neighborhood crime influence on AirBnB listings

Investigating the influence of crime rate in New York City on the number of AirBnB listings per neighberhood.

## Research motivation
The growth in popularity of peer-to-peer rental platforms such as AirBnB in recent years has brough several benefits but also concerns to the neighbourhoods. One of the major concerns is the crime rate in the neighbourhoods around AirBnB rental properties. Not only the people living in these areas get affected in terms of their safety, but also crime has to be shown to have a negative effect on property values and businesses (Lens and Meltzer, 2016). Thefore, it is important to investigate how the growth of AirBnB affects the crime rate. For the purpose of this study, an example of in New York City will be used. The data on AirBnB listings in NY City is available on Inside AirBnB and the complaint data reported to the New York City Police is available on NYC Open Data.

## Methodology
First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem. Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate. The investigated time span is from X till X. All data is daily/monthly etc. Regression analysis -Crime and listings are grouped per neighborhood -listing id's and date, first and last available date to see when a listing was removed -total amount of listings per neighborhood (crime and listings) -looked at the type of crime -look into the effect of different type of crime on the listings

Possible Sub-questions to investigate:
Investigating the cost/benifit analysis of growing number of Airbnb listings
Are the owners of Airbnb listings actual residents of the neighborhoods they list? 
Are they outsiders to whom profits are siphoned out of the community?
Do the dollars generated by users of Airbnbs outweigh any possible expenses that may come with a possible greater vulnerability to crime?
