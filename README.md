A subtitle that describes your project, e.g., research question

## Research motivation
*Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved.*
The growth in popularity of peer-to-peer rental platforms such as Airbnb in recent years has brough several benefits but also concerns to the neighbourhoods. One of the major concerns is the crime rate in the neighbourhoods around Airbnb rental properties. Not only the people living in these areas get affected in terms of their safety, but also crime has to be shown to have a negative effect on property values and businesses (Lens and Meltzer, 2016). Thefore, it is important to investigate how the growth of AirBnB affects the crime rate. For the purpose of this study, an example of in New York City will be used. The data on Airbnb listings in NY City is available on Inside Airbnb and the complaint data reported to the New York City Police is available on NYC Open Data.

## Methodology and results
*First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.*
*Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.*
The investigated time span is from X till X. All data is daily/monthly etc.
