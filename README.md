# Neighborhood crime influence on AirBnB listings

Investigating the influence of crime rate in New York City on the number of AirBnB listings per neighberhood.

## Research motivation
The growth in popularity of peer-to-peer rental platforms such as AirBnB in recent years has brought several benefits but also concerns to the neighbourhoods. One of the major concerns is the crime rate in the neighbourhoods around AirBnB rental properties. Not only the people living in these areas get affected in terms of their safety, but also crime has to be shown to have a negative effect on property values and businesses (Lens and Meltzer, 2016). Therefore, it is important to investigate how the growth of AirBnB affects the crime rate. For the purpose of this study, an example of in New York City will be used. The data on AirBnB listings in NY City is available on Inside AirBnB and the complaint data reported to the New York City Police is available on NYC Open Data.

## Methodology
In order to properly investigate the influence of neighboorhood crime on the number of AirBnB listings, the dataset of AirBnB listings and a dataset of neighboorhood crime in New York City need to be combined. The listings and crimes are grouped per neighboorhood. As regarding the listings, the listing id's and date are used with their first and last available date in order to see when particular was removed. The data from the neighboorhood crime dataset is also cleaned. A selection of relevant variables is made. 

The number of crimes per neigbourhood as of 2020 will be calculated in order to rank the beighbourhoods from the safest to the most dangerous. This indicator will allow tourists to choose the safest place for their holiday destination.


## Further research
Possible ideas for further research: regression analysis

A given alternative could be statistical method for further research is a multiple linear regression. Linear regression analysis is the process of using various of statistical methods that are used to approximately calculate the relationships between dependent and independent variables. Using a multiple linear regression analyis, we aim to estimate to what extent the independent variables CMPLNT_NUM,ADDR_PCT_CD,BORO,CMPLNT_FR_DT,CMPLNT_TO_DT,CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD,KY_CD,LAW_CAT_CD,OFNS_DESC,RPT_DT,Latitude,Longitude,RPT_DT influences the dependent variable, number of listings of an AirBnb. The descriptions of the aforementioned independent variables can be found in the Rmarkdown file. The output of the regression provides insights into to what extent neighbourhood crime influences Airbnb listings in New York City. 

Possible Sub-questions to investigate:
Investigating the cost/benefit analysis of growing number of Airbnb listings
Are the owners of Airbnb listings actual residents of the neighborhoods they list? 
Are they outsiders to whom profits are siphoned out of the community?
Do the dollars generated by users of Airbnbs outweigh any possible expenses that may come with a possible greater vulnerability to crime?

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that the safest to the most dangerous neigbourhoods in New York are (measured in the number of crimes per Airbnb listing):
1. Staten Island: 353
2. Bronx: 1104
3. Queens: 5323
4. Brooklyn: 14716
5. Manhattan: 16781
